# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). 

It was built using HTML and CSS. The goal is to match the page as much as possible as the images under the design folder. style-guide.md gives important information of the design such as colors and fonts used.
